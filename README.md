## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

### 📂 Folder Structure

* Place solutions inside one of the difficulty folders:

  ```
  Easy/
  Medium/
  Hard/
  ```
* File naming convention:

  ```
  <problem_number>_<problem_name>.<ext>
  ```

  * Example: `1_two_sum.py`

### 📝 Commit Message Format

Each commit should contain:

1. **Problem number and title** (same as LeetCode)
2. **Topics as hashtags**

Format:

```
<problem_number>. <Problem Title> -- #topic1 #topic2 ...
```

Examples:

```
1. Two Sum -- #array #hashtable
42. Trapping Rain Water -- #stack #two-pointers
```

  * ✅ Total problems solved count
  * ✅ Topics checklist (marked once you’ve solved at least one problem in that topic)
